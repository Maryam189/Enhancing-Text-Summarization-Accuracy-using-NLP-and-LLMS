# Enhancing-Text-Summarization-Accuracy-using-NLP-and-LLMS
This project focused on improving abstractive text summarization with models like DistilBERT, T5-Small, and BART. Models were fine-tuned on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset using NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs and evaluated using ROUGE-L, METEOR, and BERTScore to enhance summarization quality.
