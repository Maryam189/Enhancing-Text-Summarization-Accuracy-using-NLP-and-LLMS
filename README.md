# Enhancing Text Summarization Accuracy using NLP and LLMS

## Project Overview
This project focuses on improving the accuracy of text summarization through advanced generative AI models. We employ DistilBERT, T5-Small, and BART models, extensively fine-tuned for the abstractive summarization of text.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For implementing and managing pre-trained models.
- **PyTorch 1.7.1**: Used for model training and evaluation.
- **Google Colab**: Provides free GPU access for large-scale computations.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
Extensive preprocessing techniques to optimize model input, including tokenization and sequence length adjustment.

### Model Training
Utilizes NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs, ensuring efficient model training and execution.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Detailed tuning of model parameters like learning rate and batch size to maximize performance.

## Results
### Performance Metrics
Evaluation using ROUGE-L, METEOR, and BERTScore to assess the effectiveness of the summarization models.

### Model Comparison
Comparative analysis of the different models to determine the most effective configuration for text summarization tasks.

## Future Work
### Model Enhancements
Explore additional models and configurations to further improve summarization accuracy.

### Dataset Expansion
Consider the inclusion of more diverse datasets to generalize model capabilities across different text types.

### Real-time Application
Implementation of the models in real-time applications for dynamic summarization needs.
